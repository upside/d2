# Equipment set references

Use this folder for **full-set** references (a coherent look across multiple equipped items).

Why: the agent can match metal/leather tones, ornament language, and silhouette across helmet/armor/belt/boots/etc.

Recommended structure:

- `starter/` — low-level gear sets (simple materials, fewer ornaments)
- `mid/` — mid-tier sets (more detail, distinct faction motifs)
- `endgame/` — high-tier sets (iconic silhouettes, rare materials)

If you only have single-item references, place them in the existing folders:

- `armor/`, `weapons/`, `Rings/`, `Amulets/`, `Potions/`, `Gems/`, `Runes/`.

Filename tips:

- Prefer descriptive names: `starter_leather_set_01.png`, `rusted_iron_set_02.jpg`.
- Keep source links (optional) in a companion `.txt` file next to the image.
